                <strong><u>Background:</u> </strong> The general problem of n bodies, where n is greater than three, has been attacked vigorously with numerical techniques on powerful computers. 
                Celestial mechanics in the solar system is ultimately an n-body problem, but the special configurations and relative smallness of the perturbations have 
                allowed quite accurate descriptions of motions (valid for limited time periods) with various approximations and procedures without any attempt to solve 
                the complete problem of n bodies.

                Examples are the restricted three-body problem to determine the effect of Jupiter’s perturbations of the asteroids and the use of successive approximations 
                of series solutions to sequentially add the effects of smaller and smaller perturbations for the motion of the Moon. 
                In the general n-body problem, all bodies have arbitrary masses, initial velocities, and positions; the bodies interact through Newton’s law of gravitation,
                 and one attempts to determine the subsequent motion of all the bodies. 
                 Many numerical solutions for the motion of quite large numbers of gravitating particles have been successfully completed where the precise motion of 
                 individual particles is usually less important than the statistical behaviour of the group.
