## Project Description
2-D Simulations created to help visualize the n-body problem and its greater context in describing celestial motion.

## Context
The n-body problem describes the motion of "n" objects under the influence eachothers gravitational field. As described by Brittanica: "In the general n-body problem, all bodies have arbitrary masses, initial velocities, and positions; the bodies interact through Newton’s law of gravitation, and one attempts to determine the subsequent motion of all the bodies." This theoretical equation is closely linked with the motion of celestial bodies, leading to centuries of research and testing to find a general solution. Although many approximations have been found (such as restricted 3-body problems of Jupiter’s effect on asteroids), an exact general equation has yet to be discovered.

## Inspiration
Our team wanted to contribute our visualizations to the body of n-body research in the hopes that a general solution will be found.

## Capabilities
- To-scale simulation of the solar-system
- 2-body, 3-body, and sandbox simulations
- Dynamic simulation parameters (Mass size and object quantity)

## How we built it
Our website is based on HTML5 and CSS3. We used p5.js to create the 2-d physics simulations in Javascript. AI was used to make this project in the following ways: 
- Debugging physics simulations based on p5.js
- General research on how to implement p5.js into our project

## Challenges we ran into
- Learning p5.js and implementing it into a website
- Accurate math equations that constrain our simulation to a physically-consistent model

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Visualizations we were able to create
- Creating and implementing a website through Github Pages

## What we learned
- Physics modeling using p5.js
- Website design
- Mathematics that describes kinematic motion

## What's next for Orbital Simulation and the N-Body Problem
- More physically-accurate models
- Potential for 3-D Simulation incorporating libraries like Three.js, Ammo.js, etc.
- Preset masses that are similar to existing celestial bodies (planets, asteroids, etc)
- Better visuals for our simulation
